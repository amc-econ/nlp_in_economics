    - a bullet point
    * also a bullet point
    + yet a third way of writing a bullet point

#. With numbered lists Pandoc will figure out the correct numbering for you
    - Isn't that cool?

#. You can mix math inline $$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$$ or in display mode:
    $$
    \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} + \frac{e}{f}
    $$
    
    
    you can use an inline formula $$\forall x \in R$$ like this one

#.  You can mix styles
    a) sublist with alphabetical
    b) nice, eh?
