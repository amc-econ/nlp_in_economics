# Using NLP in innovation and competition economics

- This is the main repository for my research at KU Leuven. 

- It contains several projects **applying natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to economic problems**.

## Research projects

1. `nlp_patent_classification`: creation of a theoretical model to classify technologies using a NLP-powered citation network. [Source code and presentations.](https://github.com/amc-econ/nlp_patent_classification)
1. `innovation_in_wind_tech`: unpacking innovation in wind technologies using NLP on patent data. This is an application of the technological classification model above. [Source code and presentations.](https://github.com/amc-econ/innovation_in_wind_tech)
1. `learning_microeconometrics_with_python`: Python code for Christopher Adams's book *"Learning Microeconometrics with R"*. [Source code.](https://github.com/amc-econ/learning_microeconometrics_with_python)
1. `nlp_state_aid_decisions`: Python code to collect, clean and process European Commission's State aid decisions. [Source code (private for the moment).](https://github.com/amc-econ/nlp_state_aid_decisions)
